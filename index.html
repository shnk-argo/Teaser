    <h2>An Ode to American Craftsmanship</h2>
    <p>No food supply chain displays the cracks in our American values more evidently than in fish. Fraud, smuggling, and waste run rampant across our country – the industry is run by the mafia of the old world. American fish are purely graded on size and exporters have no incentive for quality. Compare that to Japan: to serve their sushi in the highest quality restaurants, chefs run their own artisanal supply chains. Their fishermen are so focused on the perfection of their craft, many chefs (and the fishermen themselves) consider it a privilege to buy their fish. Some fishermen have such a selective process they refuse buyers no matter the price.</p>

    <h2>America’s Weakened Footing</h2>
    <p>This domestic oversight has left us undefended against the forces of globalization. An estimated 80% of American fish are imported, low-grade shit. We have a net seafood trade deficit of $18B – most of our finfish are processed and our shellfish produced in China, Thailand, and Vietnam. While China cut their US imports in half, we pay our own tariffs when they import, process, and sell our own fish back to us. We are losing silent trade wars.</p>
    <p>The control of our food supply is increasingly threatened. China harvests 4x the second largest seafood-producing country (and 18x the US). Two generations ago, domestic catfish producers dominated our local market. Today, they can’t compete with Vietnamese prices that have driven catfish down to commodities.</p>
    <p>As you read this, China flies diseased fish over to LA that were covered in fungus a few hours ago, disguised by bleaching and dyeing. To top it off, we have no idea what they sneak into our food: their produce is genetically-modified and we are left exposed. We’re not self-reliant: our population could slowly be poisoned, and we’d have no defense.</p>

    <h2>In Honor of the American Future</h2>
    <p>Fishing is subject to the tragedy of the commons in that all fish are accessible to everyone – so fishermen aren’t reprimanded for malpractice and waste. Yet, there are no cameras, laws, or ability to govern these boats. The industry needs a digital spinal cord whose nerves extend to the ocean. We need to harness technology not for the sake of technology but the sake of humanity. For our American vitality.</p>
    <p>A once manual practice can unlock a sea of change.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fish 0.1 was the hook and line fishing of pre-industrial systems.</li><br>
      <li>Fish 1.0 is the mass capture aboard industrial vessels.</li><br>
      <li>Fish 2.0 will be the automated and digitized catch and transport of fish. Onshoring our seafood, our ships automate artisanal end-to-end supply chains where you know exactly when and where your best-in-class fish were caught — and can view it all in real-time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Robotics is just the start — we’re building the operating system of the ocean.</p>
